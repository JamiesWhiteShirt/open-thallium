# OpenThallium

A libre implementation of [Thallium's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thallium) FPS inflation. OpenThallium aims to be an open source alternative to Thallium that inflates the FPS even further. OpenThallium is compatible with Sodium.

See what the community has to say about OpenThallium:

- "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes." - Charles Goodhart

## How does it work?

Like Thallium, OpenThallium duplicates frames to increase FPS without actually improving the visual quality. OpenThallium is capable of duplicating a frame up to 49 times, vastly outperforming the original Thallium on all systems.

Make sure to disable vsync for maximum FPS.

## Why OpenThallium?

With the 1.1 release of Thallium, its open source license was removed. The goal of OpenThallium is to advance FPS inflation technology even further, as a community effort.

## Future goals

- Duplicating frames more than 49 times
- TPS inflation
